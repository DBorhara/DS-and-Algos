# Dynamic Programming

## What is it?

Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique

If you can cache something, it is Dynamic Programming

Is a way to solve problems by breaking it down into a collection of subproblems and solving them just once, and using the solved problem next time it comes up.

## Memoization & Caching

Memoization is essentially just caching the elements in an object.

## DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING RULES

Divide & Conquer + Memoization

1. Can be divided into subproblems
2. Recursive Solution
3. Are there repetitve subproblems?
4. Memoize sub problems
5. Demand a raise from your boss
